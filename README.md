## Project Overview

This project involves a detailed analysis of a dataset representing sales data for Adidas in the United States. The aim is to uncover insights into sales patterns, profitability, and customer preferences.

### Data Source: [Kash on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushiksuresh147/adidas-vs-nike). It contains transactional sales data for various Adidas products across different regions in the US.
## Key Insights
